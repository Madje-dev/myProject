- [x] Get Keyboard input
- [ ] Get mouse input
- [x] Draw Triangle
- [x] change background color
- [x] Created two rectangles
- [x] understood better, VBO, VAO and EBO
- [x] created two shaders as well

# Learn how to do the following
- [ ] how to import points
- [ ] How to create a mesh
- [ ] How to put an image on top of the mesh
- [ ] How to do terrain mapping


# Stage 1 of learning
- [x] Window creation (GLFW)
- [ ] Shaders (GLSL)
- [ ] Buffers (VBO, VAO, EBO)
- [ ] Textures & transformations
## Project
Deliverable: a working 3D demo (rotating cube, lighting, textures).

# Stage 2: Intermediate Graphics (3–4 months)
- [ ] Cameras & 3D navigation
- [ ] Lighting models (Phong, Blinn-Phong)
- [ ] Framebuffers, shadow mapping
- [ ] Model loading (Assimp)
## Project
Deliverable: a small 3D scene with lighting + multiple objects.

# Stage 3: Advanced Rendering (4–6 months)
- [ ] Deferred rendering
- [ ] Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
- [ ] Post-processing (HDR, bloom, motion blur)
- [ ] Instancing & optimization
## Project
Deliverable: a simple rendering engine.
